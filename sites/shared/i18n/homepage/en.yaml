what1: FreeSewing is open source software to generate made-to-measure sewing patterns, loved by home sewers and fashion entrepreneurs alike.
what2: FreeSewing.org makes this software available to you as an online tool with unmatched custimization and flexibility. We have over 50 designs, and regularly add new ones. You can pick any design and generate a pattern to your exact measurements.
what3: Because made-to-measure lies at the heart of what we do, we strongly suggest you take accurate measurements. Industry sizing is a bunch of lies. Join the slow fashion revolution and enjoy clothes that fit you.
whatNot1: FreeSewing is not a company. We do not sell anything. We do not have staff or employees. We do not have an office. We do not get paid.
whatNot2: Our websites do not contain any advertising. We do not track you or sell your personal data. We do not violate your privacy.
whatNot3: FreeSewing is not gendered. We do not exclude or discriminate. Nor do we tolerate discrimination in our community.
whatNot4: FreeSewing is not perfect. But we try our best. When we come up short, we will not be upset when you point it out.
whatNot5: In fact, that is how we got to where we are today.

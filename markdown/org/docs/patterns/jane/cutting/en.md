title: "Jane Shift: Cutting Instructions"

The best way to get a truly straight line for all the straight seams in Jane is to pull a thread. [link]

There are two different ways to cut Jane, with or without a shoulder seam. The pattern doesnâ€™t include a back and front to save on paper.

If you are cutting Jane with a shoulder seam you:
- cut one body part with front neckline
- cut one body part with back neckline
- cut gusset line in front and back part
- repeat on the other side of the body
- cut two sleeve parts 
- cut two sleeve gusset parts 

If you want to cut Jane without a shoulder seam you:
- cut on fold as indicated on the pattern
- cut the body
- cut the neckline
- with body folded at the cut on fold line, cut side gussets 
- repeat on the other side of the body
- cut two sleeve parts 
- cut two sleeve gusset parts 

Cutting out without a pattern 
In the past shifts were generally cut without a paper pattern. If you want to cut without a pattern as well you can use the following instructions: 

Cut a rectangle double the body length and the body width. You can cut the side gussets all in one go. To do this you fold your fabric at the shoulder line and then mark the halfway point down the length. 

Then you mark your shoulder width (the distance from the shoulder to the beginning of the dotted line). And mark the side gusset by tracing a line from the point marked to the midpoint of the body length. 

Then you fold the body in half widthwise. There should be 4 layers of fabric at the edge now. To cut the gusset you now cut the line you just drew through all four layers. 

Now cut the neckline, the sleeves and the sleeve gussets.

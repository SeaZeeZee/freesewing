title: Your Measurements Sets
order: 350
---

Once you have an account, you can start adding measurements.
But that quickly brings up the next question: what if you want
a pattern for you, but also for your partner?

That's why we have _measurements sets_.

You create a measurements set, and add measurements to that.
Now you can generate patterns for this person, based on their measurements.

You can add as many measurements sets as you like. Having just one for yourself is fine too.
